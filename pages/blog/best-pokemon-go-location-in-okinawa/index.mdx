Pokemon Go has became a source of fun and activity for my whole Japanese family. Even our grandparents play! And I tell you, they are the one who diligently do everything without slack. Funny fact is that my grandfather is the first one out of all of us to reach level 40.

After recently moving and having settled in Okinawa, one of the journeys me and my partner has was to find the best place to spend our Pokemon Go adventures. When traveling around, it was great to have another goal in mind than just wandering. We found ourselves to be exploring places we would have never thought we would try to go if not for the game. From hiking mountain trails, discovering hidden shrines, learning about historical places, and taking notice of the art and sculptures that we fail to notice despite walking in front of them everyday.

If you are looking for the *best place to play Pokemon Go Community day in Okinawa*, then this blog is for you!

## Pallete Kumoji, Naha

Pallete Kumoji is a department store in Naha near Kokusai Dori. This location is best *for those who wish to staying idle on one location for reading or laptop work*, but still not get left behind on the community day catches and quests. This location reaches **7 pokestops and a gym** without moving away from your table! The pokestops clustering around here is mostly because of the Pokemon Shop located in Pallete mall, which is by the way the smallest Pokemon Center I have seen so far. (Update: Pokemon store of Pallete Kumoji has closed, and moved to [Rycom mall](#rycom))

The recommended place to stay is on the **Rakuen Cafe Okinawa** on second floor which is connected to a wide terrace in front of the mall. Rakuen Cafe Okinawa have healthy meal selection, both vegan and nonvegan.

The vegetarian taco rice is my choice. The minced meat mixed with taco seasoning is instead replaced with tofu. I recommend this not only for vegetarian but for anyone who is looking for a healthy and delicious Okinawan meal.

## Aeon Mall Rycom {#rycom}

Rycom is the biggest mall in Okinawa which opened in 2015. The mall is so big that your Pogo GPS will keep moving despite being on a building; truly a *great place to walk* and *hatch eggs* without needing to go outside. Since itâ€™s indoors, it is recommended to go here on events during rainy or scorching hot weathers. Also there are a total of **6 gyms** which is the best location you can get in Okinawa for raid events.

There are five gyms on the image above but one is on top of another gym.
