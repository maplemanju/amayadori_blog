Suffering from dry, oily, unruly, dull, and different hair problems are very common. Feeling envious of seeing Japanese high school girls with a healthy beautiful hair is a natural thing since hair is a big part of our appearance as well as our daily life. I often imagine myself having a very easy to manage hair that I will just have to dry it and it will look smooth and radiant without any effort, it will then take out a lot of my daily stress and make myself feel more confident. Having less stress and more confidence of course will affect my mood and my mood will affect those around me. So yes, having our healthy dream hair is not just for appearances but it is deeply connected to our life.

My hair is in the middle of curly and straight. It's wavy and the waves are not really curving attractively. Having a dry and dull hair makes it even more awful. The solution I found was chemical straightening in the salon which last for half a year, then my hair will be back to its *usual self*.

Moving to Japan, I started to rehabilitate my hair and avoided damaging practices. If I am not getting chemical treatment, not using hair iron or even hot blow dryer, but my natural hairs stayed dull, then that was when I thought maybe it’s on the shampoo and conditioner that I use. I once found a treatment and after using it, I got immediate results and my hair got so nice and smooth. However, after using that treatment for a couple of months, my hair went back to how it was before. I researched about why my hair stopped getting the effects of the product I am using and I found out that **the cause was silicon building up on hair and blocking nourishment**.

From then on I started looking for silicon free products and I figured to try the natural and organic hair products here in Japan. They can be hard to find specially the descriptions on the back are all in Japanese, I thought this will be helpful so read below to on check my search for organic and natural hair products in Japan.
