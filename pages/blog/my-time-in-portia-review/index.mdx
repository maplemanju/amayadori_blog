My Time at Portia is closely similar to every farming simulation game but focuses on the concept of the economic growth of the town. Because of this, it offers more sources of income besides farming wide acres of crops repeatedly everyday. If you fell in love with Harvest Moon, Star Dew Valley and Rune Factory, this game will surely be added to your unforgettable gaming experience. It has most or all aspects we loved on our classic farming sim games such as progressing relationships, mining, fishing, crafting and with other additional RPG concepts such as fighting monsters and completing quests from the guild and townspeople. I believe this is the most detailed but at the same the time it is not loaded with information that disrupts the ease of play.

## The World

The graphics are 3D, making the world here more immersive. Additionally it has the art quality that tops other farming simulation games with cute pastel colors that attracts the cutest of gamers. The in-game world has that old beach side European architecture, similar to isekai and the cute RPG worlds we know. In contrary to what it looks like, the world is actually set in the future, but with the older world wiped out and what remains are the relics and knowledge of the past. My time at Portia is what it will look like several years later of Dr. Stone as one of the small towns that emerges after discovering the knowledge spread out by Senku and the gang.

## The Characters

The character creation have a very customizable settings similar to modern MMORPGS, from the length of your hair to the color your tattoos. The other townspeople have similar character styling but everyone has a different vibe where you can freely choose your romantic partner based on your preference â€”  a reliable glasses wearing doctor, a very cute florist, a rough monster fighting guy, and a chubby guy who likes to fish.

## The Gameplay

Just like any other simulation games, there is an in game time which passes faster than real life. You will need to sleep in your house every night, saving your game before starting a new day. You will also need to manage your stamina level to perform tasks that involves using your tools. The RPG side of this game adds an HP bar which you can heal using food or potions. HP can decrease from getting hit by monsters. The monsters in My Time in Portia are not the main obstacles in this world. They spawn outside of town and they are very useful because of their drops that are often in demand by the townspeople and also as crafting materials.

The main gameplay line is taking in commissions from the guild requested by townspeople and using the money earned to invest on your own crafting and improving your career and workshop. The main quest line follows your progress as a builder giving you more reputation on completion which also sets your goals most of the game.

## Is this game worth to purchase and play?

My Time at Portia is a very worthy game to play overall. Although not action packed and hero please save the world type of game, this is instead the laid back and the genius farmer please save the town type. The world immersion can get really deep to the point that you might get lost and dream Portia as your real life. I can say if you love simulations games, but is also looking for improvement and different gameplay from the classic games that brought laid back other-world farming to us then this game is for you.
