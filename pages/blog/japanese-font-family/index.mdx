Japanese sans-serif fonts are called Gothic (ゴシック), while serif fonts are Mincho (明朝). Their difference are that of Mincho being stylized at the end of strokes while Gothic have even thickness.

Japanese font-family can be hard to search for while figuring out all their differences and whether they are still supported. Because different OS have different available fonts, it is especially hard to check for how they are displayed on your website.

Here are a list of all available Japanese fonts on different OS with their release dates and images for easy comparison without viewing from another device.
